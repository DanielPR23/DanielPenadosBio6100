#This could in here, and it would be a big chunk of code. 
#But with a more complex code, you could place them in a different script, and juts load them in here. 
#For this time we are going to load them here. 




# Global variables---------------



# Main body of the Code --------------
#If we have done this right, there is not gonna be much in here, the strongest part of the code is gonna be part of the Functions.
